# ECSE 250 Assignment 2 Instruction
## Folder Structure
<pre>
  +--- src  
      +---assignment2
          +--- Deck.java  
          +--- SolitaireCipher.java
      ...  

</pre>

After you clone the repository, you should notice that the folder structure of the project is as described above.
You should write the solution only in **Deck.java** and **SolitaireCipher.java**.

**Do not change any of the starter code that is given to you**. Add code only where instructed, namely in the “ADD YOUR CODE HERE” block. This includes:

– Do not change the folder structure (including the package name) of the starter code. Otherwise, your code may not be compilable.

– If you found that you have to change the folder structure to make it work in IntelliJ,there are probably problems with you IntelliJ setup for the “root of the source code”. Make sure IntelliJ recognizes the src folder as the root for your source code. You
can check for more information at this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/content-roots.html#configure-folders.

– Do not change any given code (e.g., names of the classes or methods, return types or parameters, etc).

– Do not add any additional import statements.



## Submission Instruction
You should only submit the required Java files.
We have added a .gitignore file so that it will automatically ignore some unnecessary files when you push, but still be careful when you push (use git add <> as required) your project.


**All your work must be submitted on GitHub. Similar to previous weekly assignments, only your code on GitHub will be graded. For more details, refer to the Assignment Specifications released on MyCourses.**

### Important
Please make sure that the submitted java files of you are compilable. Starting from this assignment, we would not fix your compilation error and you will lose all your mark if the solution is not compilable.
